## 🎯 Monetization Strategies

### Strategy 1: **Freemium Model** ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**How It Works:**

- Add premium features that require a license key
- Users activate premium with a purchased key

#### ✅ FREE Features (Current - Keep Forever)
- Toggle highlight (single color)
- Basic keyboard shortcuts
- Simple comments
- Tree view sidebar
- Export/Import
- 5 default colors

#### 💎 PREMIUM Features (Add Later)

**Tier 1: Pro Features ($9.99 one-time OR $2.99/month)**
- **Advanced color schemes** (custom colors, gradients, themes)
- **Cloud sync** (sync highlights across devices)
- **Advanced search** (find highlights across entire workspace)
- **Custom themes** (dark mode highlights, opacity control)
- **Unlimited highlights** (free limited to 50)
- **Priority support** (email support within 24h)

**Tier 2: Team Features ($49.99/year)**
- Everything in Pro
- **Team collaboration** (shared highlights in real-time)
- **Team workspaces** (shared highlight collections)

---

### Strategy 2: **Separate Extensions**

**How It Works:**

- Clear separation
- Easy to market

**Cons:**

---

### Strategy 3: **Time-Limited Trial** (Best Conversion Rate)

**How It Works:**
- All features free for 14-30 days
- After trial, premium features locked
- Users must purchase to continue

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Check trial status
const installDate = context.globalState.get<number>('installDate');
const trialDays = 14;
const now = Date.now();
const daysElapsed = (now - installDate) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);

if (daysElapsed > trialDays && !isPremium()) {
    // Lock premium features
    showTrialExpiredMessage();
}
```

**Pros:**
- High conversion rate (users get hooked)
- Users experience all features

**Cons:**
- Can annoy some users
- Need good trial messaging

---

### Strategy 4: **Usage-Based Pricing**

**How It Works:**
- Free: Up to 50 highlights
- Premium: Unlimited highlights + advanced features

**Pros:**
- Fair pricing model
- Clear value proposition

**Cons:**
- Need to track usage
- May limit adoption

```typescript
async validateGumroadLicense(key: string): Promise<boolean> {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.gumroad.com/v2/licenses/verify', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({
            product_id: 'YOUR_PRODUCT_ID',
            license_key: key
        })
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.success === true;
}
```

**Best For:** Solo developers, quick launch

                    license_key: key
                })

            const data: any = await response.json();

            if (data.success === true) {

                );
                return true;
            }

            return false;

                        vscode.env.openExternal(
                            vscode.Uri.parse('https://github.com/housamkak/highlightability#readme')
                        );

    }
}
```

### Usage in Commands

```typescript
// In your command handler
export async function activateCloudSync(
    context: vscode.ExtensionContext,
    licenseManager: LicenseManager
) {
    // Check if feature is enabled
    if (!licenseManager.isFeatureEnabled('cloud-sync')) {
        licenseManager.showUpgradeMessage('Cloud Sync');
        return;
    }

    // Premium feature code here
    await performCloudSync();
}
```

---

### Adding License Commands to package.json

```json
{
  "contributes": {
    "commands": [
      {
        "command": "highlightability.activateLicense",
        "title": "Activate Pro License",
        "category": "Highlightability"
      },
      {
        "command": "highlightability.viewLicenseStatus",
        "title": "View License Status",
        "category": "Highlightability"
      },
      {
        "command": "highlightability.upgradeToPro",
        "title": "Upgrade to Pro",
        "category": "Highlightability"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 🔐 Important Notes

### Can You Do This Even Though Code is Public?

**YES!** Here's why:

1. **"All Rights Reserved" License**: Even if code is visible on GitHub, people CANNOT legally use it without permission

2. **License Key Validation**: Your extension checks for a valid license key from YOUR server

3. **Server-Side Control**: License validation happens on your server, not in the client code

4. **No Bypass Possible**: Without a valid key from your server, premium features won't work

### Real Examples:
- **GitHub Desktop**: Open source but has GitHub Enterprise (paid)
- **GitKraken**: Free version + Pro features (gated by license)
- **Sourcegraph**: Open source core, premium features require license
- **Many VS Code Extensions**: Free + Pro tiers with license gates

---

## 🎯 Recommended Approach

### Start Simple:

1. **Keep current features FREE forever** (build user base)
2. **Add 2-3 premium features** that provide real value:
   - Cloud sync (most requested)
   - Custom colors (easy to implement)
   - Advanced search (high value)
3. **Use Gumroad or LemonSqueezy** for simple license key sales
4. **Price at $9.99 one-time** (low barrier, no recurring billing hassle)
5. **Add "Upgrade to Pro" prompts** strategically (not annoying)

### Why This Works:

- ✅ You keep full control (All Rights Reserved)
- ✅ Build a free user base (viral growth)
- ✅ Generate revenue from premium features
- ✅ Simple to implement (no complex backend)
- ✅ Low maintenance (Gumroad handles payments)
- ✅ Can always add subscription option later
