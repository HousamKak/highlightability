Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) = Revenue / Ad Spend

Example:
Ad Spend: $500
Installs: 500
Conversion Rate: 3%
Pro Subscriptions: 15
Revenue: 15 × $9.99 = $149.85

CPA: $500 / 15 = $33.33
ROAS: $149.85 / $500 = 0.30 (30%)

Break-even CPA: $9.99
Target ROAS: >3.0 (300%)

Verdict: Not profitable yet, focus on organic growth
```
